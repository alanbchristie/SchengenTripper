# Pylint
# To check import errors we need to install every package
# used by the DM. This is often impractical on the client,
# and so we disable import errors on pre-commit and rely
# on this category of test in the CI stage. Consequently,
# pylint may pass on pre-commit but fail in CI - but at least
# the user has done 90% of the lint checks before the code
# hits the server.
